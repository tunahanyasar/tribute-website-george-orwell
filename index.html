        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          George Orwell was one of the most significant English writers of the
          20th century, known for his political and social critiques. Born Eric
          Arthur Blair in 1903 in India, his most famous works include 1984 and
          Animal Farm. Orwell was a strong critic of totalitarian regimes and
          social inequality. His writings often explore themes such as
          government oppression, individual freedoms, and the questioning of
          justice. He also worked as a journalist and fought in the Spanish
          Civil War. Orwell is a key figure in modern literature, known for his
          emphasis on the power of language and manipulation.

        <h2>Early Career</h2>
        <p>
          George Orwell’s early career began after he attended Eton, where he
          was recognized for his writing skills, though he did not excel
          academically. After school, he joined the Indian Imperial Police in
          Burma, a job he took to escape his lower-middle-class background. His
          time in Burma, however, left him disillusioned with imperialism, an
          experience that would later influence his works. Orwell returned to
          England and struggled to establish himself as a writer, taking on
          various low-paying jobs, including as a teacher and a bookseller. His
          first notable work, Down and Out in Paris and London (1933), was an
          autobiographical account of his time living in poverty, marking the
          beginning of his career as a social and political writer.

        <h2>Burmese Days (1934)</h2>
        <p>
          George Orwell's first novel, Burmese Days (1934), was inspired by his
          experiences serving in the Indian Imperial Police in Burma. The novel
          portrays the harsh realities of British colonial rule, focusing on the
          corrupt and oppressive nature of the imperial system. Set in a
          fictional town in Burma, the story follows John Flory, a disillusioned
          British official, as he grapples with his own moral dilemmas, racism,
          and the complexities of colonial society. The novel, though not
          initially a commercial success, laid the groundwork for Orwell's
          future works, showcasing his emerging concerns with social injustice
          and the abuse of power.
